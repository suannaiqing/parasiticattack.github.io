<h1 class="centered-title">Demystifying Risks of Model Parasitic Attacks
Against Transfer Learning Models</h1>

<p class="centered-paragraph">We demonstrate two physical-world MP-based semantic backdoor attacks. One is embedding Road sign 66 into the stop sign (video 1), and the other is embedding the streetlight into the speed limit 120km/h sign (video 2).</p>

<h4 class="centered-title"> Video 1.  The label-to-label mapping is from the class of stop sign in GTSRB to the  class of road sign 66</h4>

<p>The scenarios for physical attacks are as follows. On the highway, a normal self-driving vehicle will recognize road sign 66 as a stop sign, so as to make the action of stopping. If there is a car behind the self-driving vehicle at this time, then it is very easy to cause a chain of car accidents. </p>

<h4 class="centered-title">Video 2.  The label-to-label mapping is from the class of speed limit 120km/h in GTSRB to the class of streetlight</h4>

<p>The scenarios for physical attacks are as follows. At night in a normal neighborhood, the self-driving vehicle recognizes the street light as a minimum speed limit 120km/h sign and thus accelerates to 120km/h. If there is a car in front of it at this time, it is very easy to cause a car accident.</p>
